# **Libft**
_________________________________

Final grade 123/100

### The Challenge 
This first project after the entrance piscine at 42 marks the beginning of our training to become a software engineer. The goal is to code a library of useful functions that we will be allowed to reuse in most of our C
projects this year. 
### Learning objectives 
This project makes you take the time to re-write the basic neceessary functions of the C library, understand them wholly, and learn to use them. 
It also demands rigour with regards to testing, and attention to detail. Beyond the required functions, we are also given the opportunity to expand the list of functions
with our own and encouraged to continue to add to the library througout the year.

#### N.B.
I have since added the get_next_line fuction from [this project](https://github.com/finolacahill/get_next_line) and the ft_printf function from [this project.](https://github.com/finolacahill/printf)
### Usage
The *make* command will compile the library to libft.a.

The *make clean* command will delete the .o files. 

The *make fclean* command will delete the .o files and the libft.a file. 

The *make re* will re compile the library.
